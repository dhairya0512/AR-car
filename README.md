# Car in Augmented Reality



## Description

The mobile application developed in Unity is an augmented reality app that allows users to view car models in a real environment. This app utilizes the camera on the user's mobile device to display a 3D car model in the real world.

The app offers users the functionality of moving, scaling, and rotating the car model to fit their desired location and angle within the real world environment. With this feature, users can position the car model in a way that it appears to be parked in their driveway or garage, or even on the street in front of their house.

In addition to this, the app also allows users to change the color of the car model. Users can select from a range of color options available to personalize the car model to their liking. This feature is especially useful for those who are considering buying a new car and want to see how different colors would look on the model they are interested in.

  Rotate
  <p>
      The application developed using AR Foundation features a range of interactive movement functionality that allows users to rotate, scale, and move the 3D car model within their real-world environment.The rotation feature allows users to turn the car model in any direction using touch gestures, such as swiping or tapping, on the mobile device's screen. This allows the user to view the car model from any angle, giving them a full 360-degree view of the car's exterior.

The scaling feature enables users to adjust the size of the car model, allowing them to make it larger or smaller according to their preference. This functionality can be useful for comparing the size of the car model to real-world objects or for getting a closer look at certain details of the car model.The moving feature allows users to reposition the car model within their real-world environment. This feature is particularly useful for placing the car model in an optimal location for viewing or for adjusting the car model's placement in relation to other objects in the environment.

The movement functionality of the Unity application developed using AR Foundation provides users with a high degree of control and interactivity with the 3D car model. With its intuitive touch controls and seamless integration with the real-world environment, users can create a truly immersive and engaging AR experience that is tailored to their preferences.

  Lighting
  <p>  The Unity application developed using AR Foundation features a highly realistic lighting system that is designed to accurately replicate the lighting conditions of the user's real-world environment. The application uses the camera on the user's mobile device to capture the ambient light in the environment and then applies this information to the 3D car model in real-time. This results in highly accurate and dynamic lighting effects that create a seamless integration between the virtual car model and the real-world environment.

In addition to the realistic lighting effects, the application also features advanced shading techniques that further enhance the visual fidelity of the 3D car model. The car model is designed with a range of materials and textures, each of which interacts with light in a different way, creating a rich and varied visual experience. The shading also creates the illusion of depth and dimensionality, making the car model appear as if it is a physical object that is present in the real-world environment.

If the lighting conditions are not optimal for the AR experience, the application will prompt the user to move to a brighter location. This ensures that the AR experience is fully optimized and that the user can achieve the best possible focus and tracking accuracy. Overall, the combination of realistic lighting and shading effects, along with the app's guidance on optimal lighting conditions, creates a highly engaging and immersive AR experience for users.

 Color changing
  <p>  The application developed using AR Foundation features a highly customizable color changing feature that allows users to choose from a range of colors to apply to the 3D car model. This feature is accessible via the application's user interface, and users can select their desired color by tapping on a color swatch.

When the user selects a new color, the application will update the 3D car model in real-time to reflect the new color choice. The car model will also respond to changes in lighting conditions, with the color appearing to shift and change depending on the ambient light in the environment.

To help users select the most appropriate color for their preferences, the application may also provide guidance or suggestions for color choices. For example, the application may provide a color palette that is optimized for the lighting conditions in the user's environment, or it may suggest colors that are popular or well-suited for the particular car model being displayed.

Overall, the color changing feature of the Unity application developed using AR Foundation provides a highly engaging and customizable experience for users. With its range of color options and responsive color shifting effects, users can experiment with different color combinations and create a truly unique and personalized AR experience.
